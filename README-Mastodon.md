# Send a Mastodon Post for each new vessel in VesselAlert

This utility enables sending Mastodon posts of new events. Ever since Twitter started to restrict posting about locations of vessels, are encouraging people to post to Mastodon,

There are two major parts to install this. Each of these parts is described below.

- You must have a Mastodon account and create an Application in it.
- You must follow the instructions below to configure VesselAlert to use the credentials that Mastodon provides you during this sign-up process.

## Signing up for a Mastodon Account and creating an Application

Mastodon is a distributed social media service. This means, that you have your choice of Mastodon servers to create and maintain your account on. Any of them will work (as long as they allow bots), but we recommend joining this one. It's the one where many of us post results of our SDR and radio reception endeavors: https://airwaves.social/

Once you have an account, please do the following:

- Sign in to Mastodon and go to the home page, for example: https://airwaves.social/home
- Click `Preferences` on the bottom right of the page

- On the bottom left, click `</> Development`

- Create a new Application by clicking the button, then:
  - Give it a name (for example, "VesselAlert")
  - Add a URL (if you don't have one, use something like "https://airwaves.social/@myhandle" (replace `myhandle` by your Mastodon handle))
  - Make sure that the following scopes are selected (important!!!): `read`, `write`, `follow`
  - Press `Submit` at the bottom of the page
